Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. 
It shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of places specified in the second operand. This is actually multiplying a number by 2 raised to the power of shift counts.

Static library - A library is a file containing several object files, that can be used as a single entity in a linking phase of a program. Normally thelibrary is indexed, so it is easy to find symbols(functions, variables and so on). For this reason linking a program whose object files are ordered in libraries is faster than linking a program whose object files are separate on the disk. Also, when using a library, we have fewerfiles to lookfor and open, which even further speeds up linking.
